Hi! I'm really excited to start this blog.

I have a passion for **AI/ML** and even **Quantum** solutions, but I don’t often get the chance to share what I’m exploring. This blog will aim to showcase various techniques and ideas using open datasets — whether it's clever ways to analyze data, hands-on coding walkthroughs, or explorations into emerging tech.

I really hope you get as much out of it as I have!

Cheers,
**Maurice B.**
